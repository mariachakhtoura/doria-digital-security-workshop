Digital Security for Feminist Activists in MENA: A Workshop

Total Time: 120 Minutes

Facilitator: \[Your Name/Title\]

Part 1: The 'Why' \- Mapping Your Digital Reality (15 mins)

Slide 1: Title Slide

Title: Building Our Digital Resilience

Subtitle: A Practical Security Workshop for Feminist Movements in the MENA Region

Your Organization's Logo

Speaker Notes:

"Hello everyone, and thank you for being here. My name is \[Your Name\], and I'm the IT officer for our fund. I want to start by saying that this is a safe and confidential space. There are no stupid questions. If you're confused, someone else probably is too. Look, I'm not here to turn you into hackers. I just want you to stop being easy targets. We're going to focus on practical steps that don't cost a lot of money or take a lot of time."

Slide 2: Why They Want to Hack Us

Headline: Why They Want to Hack Us

Content: "We do feminist work. That makes some people angry‚Äîgovernments, religious groups, trolls. And when people are angry, they attack. That's just the reality."

Three Icons/Sections:

Icon 1 (Government Building): State Actors (Surveillance, Censorship)

Icon 2 (Angry Crowd): Organized Anti-Rights Groups (Trolling, Doxxing)

Icon 3 (Hacker Mask): Opportunistic Hackers (Phishing, Scams)

Speaker Notes:

"I'm not going to sugarcoat this. Because of what we do, people want to shut us down. These threats come from state actors who monitor activists, from organized online groups who run harassment campaigns against feminists, and from opportunistic hackers who want to steal funds or disrupt our work. Recognizing this is the first step to protecting ourselves."

Slide 3: How They Target Us

Headline: The Three Most Common Attacks

Show a realistic phishing email example in Arabic/French/English with red annotations pointing to suspicious elements:

Visual Example of Phishing Email:

From: grants@feminist-fundation.org \[note the typo in "foundation"\]

Subject: URGENT: Your Grant Application Requires Immediate Action

Dear Beneficiary,

Your grant application has been approved for $15,000 USD. To receive

funds, please verify your banking details within 24 hours by clicking below:

\[VERIFY NOW\] ‚Üí hovering shows: http://bit.ly/x7k2m (not the real website)

Failure to respond will result in cancellation.

Regards,

Finance Department

Red arrows pointing to:

‚ùå Misspelled domain name

‚ùå Generic greeting

‚ùå Urgent/threatening language

‚ùå Suspicious shortened link

‚ùå Requests for banking info

The 3-Second Phishing Check:

HOVER over links before clicking (see the real URL)

CHECK the sender's actual email address (not just the display name)

ASK YOURSELF: "Was I expecting this? Is this how they normally contact me?"

Three Attack Types:

Phishing: Deceptive emails designed to steal your password

Surveillance: Monitoring your communications

Harassment: Organized campaigns to make you shut up and go away

üìñ Plain English:

Phishing \= Fake emails that look real, trying to trick you into giving up passwords or clicking malicious links

Surveillance \= Someone watching/recording your online activity

Harassment \= Coordinated attacks to intimidate or silence you online

Speaker Notes:

"These are the top three ways we see organizations targeted. Let me show you a real phishing example. See this email? It looks professional, but look closer. The email address has a typo \- 'fundation' not 'foundation.' The link goes to a random shortened URL, not the official website. They want you to panic and click without thinking. Real grant opportunities don't threaten to cancel within 24 hours. When in doubt, don't click the link. Go directly to the website yourself, or call them. A 5-minute delay won't cost you a real opportunity, but clicking could cost you everything."

Slide 3A: What is Encryption?

Headline: What is Encryption? (The Concept Behind Everything)

Visual:

Plain message: "Meeting at 3pm"

‚Üì ENCRYPTION

Encrypted: "k8\#mX@9pLz$vN2qR"

‚Üì DECRYPTION (with key)

Plain message: "Meeting at 3pm"

Simple Analogy Box:

üîí Encryption is like putting your message in a locked box. Only the person with the key can open it. Everyone else just sees a locked box full of gibberish.

üìñ Plain English:

Encryption \= Scrambling your data so only people with the "key" can read it

End-to-end encrypted \= Only you and the person you're talking to have the key. Not even the app company can read it

Unencrypted \= Like a postcard \- anyone handling it can read it

Encrypted \= Like a sealed envelope only you can open

Key Point: "When we say 'end-to-end encrypted,' we mean only you and the person you're talking to have the key. Not even WhatsApp or Signal can read it."

Speaker Notes:

"I'm going to use the word 'encryption' a lot today, so let's make sure we all understand what it means. Encryption is scrambling data so only authorized people can read it. Think of it like a secret code. Without encryption, your messages are like postcards \- anyone handling them can read them. With encryption, they're in a sealed envelope. This is the technology behind secure messaging, device protection, and safe file storage. You don't need to understand the math behind it \- you just need to know when something is encrypted and when it's not."

Part 2: The 'You' \- Fortifying Your Personal Defenses (40 mins)

Slide 4: Forget Everything You Know About Passwords

Headline: Forget Everything You Know About Passwords

Visual Comparison:

‚ùå BAD PASSWORD:

Qwe_123\!

\- Only 8 characters

\- Obvious pattern

\- Easy to crack in minutes

‚úÖ GOOD PASSPHRASE:

ÿ£ÿ≠ÿ®-ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ®ÿ©-ÿßŸÑŸÜŸäÿ©-77

or

I-Love-Coding-At-3AM-2024

\- 25+ characters

\- Easy to remember

\- Would take centuries to crack

üìñ Plain English:

Password \= Short, complex, hard to remember (the old way)

Passphrase \= Long sentence or phrase, easy to remember (the new way)

Password Manager \= A secure vault app that remembers all your passwords for you

Key Takeaway: "Length beats complexity. Always. A sentence you can remember beats a random jumble you'll forget."

How to Create a Strong Passphrase:

Pick a sentence meaningful to you: "I love kebbe nayeh every Friday"

Make it unique: Add numbers/symbols: "ILove-Kebbe-Nayeh-Every-Friday-77"

Never reuse it for multiple accounts

Password Manager Solution:

"Use a password manager to create and store unique passphrases for every account. You only have to remember ONE master passphrase."

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Using the same password everywhere (if one account is hacked, they all are)

Making passwords "complex" but short (weak)

Writing passwords on sticky notes

Sharing passwords via email or text

How to Get Started:

Download Bitwarden (FREE) or 1Password

Create a VERY strong master passphrase (you'll never forget this one)

Start adding your most important accounts

Let it generate strong, unique passwords for new accounts

üí° Real Scenario:

"In 2023, a feminist organization in our region had their email hacked because they reused the same password across 10 accounts. When one shopping website was breached, hackers got into their email, cloud storage, social media \- everything. It took them 6 months to recover. Don't be that organization."

Speaker Notes:

"Let's start with the keys to our digital lives: our passwords. The old advice about complex passwords is outdated. What you need is length. Length beats complexity. Always. A simple, long phrase is much harder for a computer to guess. And since you can't remember dozens of unique passwords, you must use a password manager. I know what you're thinking: 'Isn't putting all my passwords in one place dangerous?' Fair question. Here's the thing \- you're already using a bad password manager. It's called your brain, and it makes you reuse the same password everywhere. A real password manager is encrypted \- even the company can't see your passwords. It requires one VERY strong master password. And it means if one account is hacked, the others are safe because they all have different passwords. It's actually LESS risky than what most people do now. And no, writing them on a sticky note under your keyboard doesn't count as secure."

Slide 5: The One Thing That Actually Stops Hackers

Headline: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) \- The One Thing That Actually Stops Hackers

Visual:

LOGIN WITHOUT 2FA:

Username: maya@email.com ‚úì

Password: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* ‚úì

‚Üí ACCESS GRANTED (even if hacker has password)

LOGIN WITH 2FA:

Username: maya@email.com ‚úì

Password: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* ‚úì

Code from your phone: 482 951 ‚úì

‚Üí Hacker doesn't have your phone \= NO ACCESS

Analogy: "It's like needing TWO keys to open your door: Your password \+ a code from your phone."

üìñ Plain English:

2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) \= A second security check after your password

Authenticator App \= An app on your phone that generates temporary codes

SIM-swapping \= When a hacker tricks your phone company into transferring your number to their SIM card

Why Use an App, Not SMS:

"SMS 2FA (codes sent via text) can be intercepted through SIM-swapping attacks."

What is SIM-Swapping?

"A hacker calls your phone company pretending to be you. They say 'I lost my phone, please transfer my number to my new SIM card.' If the phone company believes them, they now receive all your text messages, including your 2FA codes. This has happened to activists in our region. That's why we use authenticator apps \- they're tied to the physical device, not your phone number."

How to Set Up 2FA (Step-by-Step):

Download Google Authenticator or Authy (both FREE)

Go to your email settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Two-factor authentication

Choose "Authenticator app" NOT "SMS"

Scan the QR code with your authenticator app

IMPORTANT: Save the backup codes in a safe place (write them down, store them offline)

Done\! Now every login requires your password \+ a 6-digit code from the app

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Choosing SMS instead of app (vulnerable to SIM-swapping)

Not saving backup codes (you're locked out if you lose your phone)

Saving backup codes on the same device (defeats the purpose)

Installing authenticator app but not enabling 2FA on important accounts

üí° Priority Accounts for 2FA:

Email (most important \- this controls everything)

Banking/financial accounts

Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)

Social media (especially if used for work)

Password manager itself

Speaker Notes:

"If you do only one thing after this workshop, do this. 2FA is a second layer of security that stops someone who has your password from getting into your account. Even if they phish your password, they can't get in without the code from your phone. Please use an app for this, not SMS. Let me explain why SMS is risky. There's an attack called SIM-swapping. A hacker calls your phone company pretending to be you and asks them to transfer your number to a new SIM card. If the company believes them, boom \- they now receive all your text messages, including your 2FA codes. This has happened to activists in our region. Authenticator apps are tied to your physical device, not your phone number, so they're much safer. And please, please save those backup codes somewhere safe. Not on your phone \- write them on paper and keep them in a secure place. If you lose your phone without backup codes, you'll be locked out of your own accounts."

Slide 6: Device Security Basics

Headline: Device Security Basics

üìñ Plain English:

Screen Lock \= Password/PIN required to use your device

Automatic Updates \= Your device installs security fixes automatically

Full-Disk Encryption \= All data on your device is scrambled and unreadable without your password

Vulnerability \= A security weakness that hackers can exploit

Essential Checklist:

1\. Screen Lock

‚úÖ What to do:

Use a STRONG PIN (at least 6 digits) or passphrase

NOT: 1234, 0000, your birthday, repeated numbers

‚úÖ How to set up:

iPhone: Settings ‚Üí Face ID & Passcode ‚Üí Change Passcode

Android: Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Screen Lock

Laptop: System settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Password required

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Using 4-digit PIN (weak \- only 10,000 possible combinations)

Using obvious patterns (1234, 2580\)

Disabling lock because "it's annoying"

Setting auto-lock to 30 minutes (way too long)

Recommended:

6+ digit PIN or full passphrase

Auto-lock after 2-5 minutes maximum

Disable fingerprint/face unlock in high-risk situations (protests, travel)

2\. Automatic Updates

‚úÖ What to do:

Turn them ON for your operating system and all apps. Updates fix security vulnerabilities.

‚úÖ How to enable:

iPhone: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Software Update ‚Üí Automatic Updates (turn ON)

Android: Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí System Update ‚Üí Auto-download over Wi-Fi

Mac: System Preferences ‚Üí Software Update ‚Üí Automatically keep my Mac up to date

Windows: Settings ‚Üí Update & Security ‚Üí Windows Update ‚Üí Advanced options ‚Üí Automatic

üìñ Why this matters:

"Updates fix security holes. Not updating is like leaving your door unlocked because you're too lazy to turn the key. Hackers actively look for people running old, unpatched software."

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Clicking "Remind me later" forever

Thinking "it works fine, why update?"

Turning off updates because they're "annoying"

üí° Real Scenario:

"In 2021, a zero-day vulnerability in WhatsApp allowed hackers to install spyware just by calling you. You didn't even have to answer. The fix? An update. Organizations that delayed updating were compromised for weeks."

3\. Full-Disk Encryption

‚úÖ What it does:

Scrambles all data on your device. If someone steals your laptop, they can't access your files without your password.

üìñ Plain English:

It's like putting everything in a safe. Even if someone physically has your device, they can't read the data without the password.

‚úÖ How to check if it's enabled:

iPhone: Settings ‚Üí Face ID & Passcode ‚Üí scroll down to "Data Protection is Enabled"

Android: Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Encryption (should say "Encrypted")

Mac: System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí FileVault (should be ON)

Windows 10/11: Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Device Encryption (should be ON)

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Thinking encryption protects you while device is ON and unlocked (it doesn't)

Using weak password/PIN (makes encryption easier to break)

Not encrypting external hard drives

CRITICAL: Encryption works best when device is powered OFF. If your device might be confiscated, power it down completely.

Speaker Notes:

"Just like we take care of our physical health, we need to take care of our digital health. This is your simple checklist. First, lock your screen. Always. And use a strong PIN \- not 1234\. I can't tell you how many organizations I've worked with where everyone uses the same 4-digit PIN or their birthday. Second, turn on automatic updates. This is non-negotiable. Updates fix security holes. Hackers actively scan the internet looking for people running old software with known vulnerabilities. Third, make sure your device's data is encrypted. Most modern phones and computers have this on by default, but let's check. The key thing to understand about encryption is that it's most powerful when your device is turned OFF. If someone can force you to unlock it while it's on, encryption can't protect you. So if you're at a checkpoint or might face confiscation, power down completely."

Slide 7: Protecting Your Money

Headline: Financial Account Security

üìñ Plain English:

Official App Store \= Apple App Store or Google Play Store (not random websites)

Phishing \= Fake messages pretending to be from your bank

Two-Factor Authentication \= Extra security requiring code from your phone

Essential Rules:

1\. Only Use Official Banking Apps

‚úÖ How to verify:

Download ONLY from Apple App Store or Google Play Store

Check the developer name (should be the actual bank)

Look at number of downloads and reviews

Never download banking apps from links in emails or SMS

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Downloading from third-party app stores

Clicking "Download Now" links in emails

Using web browser on phone instead of official app (less secure)

2\. Recognize Bank Phishing Scams

‚ùå Your bank will NEVER:

Send you a link to "verify your account"

Ask for your password via SMS, email, or phone call

Threaten to close your account within 24 hours

Request your PIN or CVV code

‚úÖ What to do instead:

Delete suspicious messages immediately

If concerned, call your bank directly (use number on your bank card, NOT the number in the message)

Go to your bank's website by typing it yourself

Never click links in banking messages

üí° Real Scenario:

"Last year, several organizations in our region received SMS messages saying 'Your bank account has been suspended. Click here to reactivate.' The link looked exactly like their bank's website. People who clicked and entered their details had their accounts emptied within hours. Remember: banks will never ask you to verify via a link."

3\. Secure Your Banking Password

‚úÖ Essential steps:

Use a STRONG, UNIQUE password (never reuse from other accounts)

Enable 2FA on your banking app (if available)

Never save banking passwords in your browser

Never share banking credentials, even with team members

How to handle organizational banking:

Designate specific authorized persons

Each person has their own login (if possible)

Document who has access

Change passwords immediately when someone leaves

Speaker Notes:

"Our finances, both personal and organizational, are major targets. These are the basics for protecting your banking information. First, only use official banking apps downloaded from the Apple or Google app stores. Never click 'download' links in emails or SMS \- those are often fake apps designed to steal your credentials. Second, I know we all get weird texts claiming to be from our bank. Delete them. Your bank will never ask for your password via SMS. Never. If you're worried, call them directly using the number on your bank card \- not the number in the message. Third, use a strong, unique password for banking. Never reuse a password from another account. If that other account gets hacked, your bank account is compromised too."

Part 3: The 'Us' \- Protecting Our Collective Shield (40 mins)

Slide 8: What Data Would Destroy Us If It Leaked?

Headline: What Data Would Destroy Us If It Leaked?

(Interactive Moment \- 30 seconds of silence):

"Take 30 seconds to think about this. You don't have to share out loud. Is it your beneficiary list? Your donor information? Your internal strategy documents? Financial records? Communications with partners?"

üìñ Plain English:

Sensitive Data \= Information that could harm people if exposed

Data Minimization \= Only collect what you absolutely need

Data Classification \= Organizing data by how sensitive it is

Types of Sensitive Data for Feminist Organizations:

üî¥ CRITICAL: Beneficiary personal information, locations, stories

üî¥ CRITICAL: Donor identities and financial information

üü° HIGH: Internal strategy documents, funding proposals

üü° HIGH: Staff/volunteer personal information

üü¢ MEDIUM: General communications, published reports

Key Principle: Data Minimization

üí° The Golden Rule:

"Here's a radical idea: don't collect data you don't absolutely need. Can't leak what you don't have."

Practical Questions to Ask:

Do we really need full names, or will initials work?

Do we need exact addresses, or will city/region suffice?

Do we need to keep this data forever, or can we delete it after 6 months?

Who actually needs access to this data?

Data Retention Policy:

‚úÖ Create a simple rule:

"Keep beneficiary data only as long as legally required or actively needed. After the project ends, securely delete it."

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Collecting "just in case" data you never use

Keeping old beneficiary data indefinitely

Storing sensitive data in easily accessible shared folders

Not having a clear policy on who can access what

üí° Real Scenario:

"An organization collected full names, addresses, phone numbers, and photos of all beneficiaries. Their laptop was stolen at an airport. All that data was exposed. If they had only collected first names and city names \- the bare minimum needed for their reports \- the stolen data would have been far less damaging."

Speaker Notes:

"Now we shift from 'me' to 'we'. As an organization, our data is our treasure \- but it's also our liability. We must know what our most sensitive data is so we can protect it properly. This isn't about being paranoid. It's about being strategic. Every piece of data you hold is a potential risk. The safest data is data you don't collect. This is called data minimization, and it's your first line of defense. Ask yourself: do we really need this information? Can we collect less? Can we anonymize it? Can we delete it after we're done with it? The less sensitive data you hold, the less damage can be done if something goes wrong."

Slide 9: Backups, Cloud Storage & AI

Headline: Secure Storage, Backups, and the AI Threat

SECTION 1: The 3-2-1 Backup Rule

üìñ Plain English:

Backup \= A copy of your data in case the original is lost

Cloud Storage \= Storing files on internet servers (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

Encryption \= Scrambling data so only you can read it

The 3-2-1 Backup Rule Explained:

3 copies of your data \= Original \+ 2 backups

2 different types of storage \= Computer \+ external hard drive (not just cloud)

1 off-site \= One backup in a different physical location

Real Example:

üìÇ Copy 1: Files on your laptop

üíæ Copy 2: External hard drive in your office drawer

‚òÅÔ∏è Copy 3: Encrypted cloud storage (different physical location)

Why?

"If your office floods or gets raided, you lose copies 1 and 2\. But copy 3 is safe in the cloud. If cloud provider goes down, you still have copies 1 and 2."

‚úÖ How to implement:

Set up automatic backups to external drive (weekly)

Set up cloud backup with encryption (daily)

Test your backups quarterly \- actually try to restore a file

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: "If you've never tried restoring from your backup, you don't actually have a backup. Test it\!"

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Only backing up to one location

Never testing if backups actually work

Storing backup drive next to computer (both destroyed in fire/flood/raid)

Uploading sensitive files to cloud without encryption

SECTION 2: Cloud Storage Security

The Cloud Reality:

"When you store files in Google Drive, Dropbox, or iCloud, the company CAN access them. Governments can request access. Hackers can breach your account."

‚úÖ How to secure cloud storage:

1\. Strong Account Security:

Unique, strong password

2FA enabled (authenticator app)

Regular security checkup

2\. Encrypt Before Uploading:

For truly sensitive files, encrypt them BEFORE uploading to cloud.

How to do this:

Use Cryptomator (FREE) or VeraCrypt

Creates encrypted folder on your computer

You put files in ‚Üí they're encrypted automatically

Upload encrypted folder to cloud

Cloud provider sees gibberish, you have encrypted backup

3\. Selective Syncing:

"Don't automatically sync everything. Be intentional about what goes to the cloud."

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Auto-syncing sensitive beneficiary data without encryption

Weak cloud account password (reused from other accounts)

No 2FA on cloud accounts

Sharing links set to "anyone with link" instead of specific people

Not reviewing who has access to shared folders

SECTION 3: The AI Threat

üö® CRITICAL WARNING:

"Never paste sensitive information into public AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any similar service."

What happens when you paste data into AI:

It may be used to train their models

It's stored on their servers

Company employees may be able to see it

It may be included in responses to other users

Governments can request access to it

‚ùå NEVER paste into AI:

Beneficiary names or personal stories

Financial information or budget details

Donor information

Internal strategy documents

Passwords or sensitive credentials

Private communications

Location data or travel plans

‚úÖ What's OK to use AI for:

General questions ("How do I write a grant proposal?")

Public information

Drafting templates (remove all specific details first)

Technical questions

üí° Real Scenario:

"An organization used ChatGPT to 'help write a report about our beneficiaries.' They pasted in real names, ages, and stories. Weeks later, they discovered parts of those stories appeared in ChatGPT's responses to other users. The data was now public. Always anonymize and generalize before using AI."

Safe AI Use Checklist:

Remove ALL identifying information before pasting

Use general scenarios, not real cases

When in doubt, don't paste it

Consider self-hosted AI tools for sensitive work

Speaker Notes:

"Protecting our sensitive data requires a proper backup plan. The 3-2-1 rule is the industry standard: 3 copies, 2 different storage types, 1 offsite. Let me break this down with a real example. Your laptop has your files \- that's copy 1\. You backup to an external hard drive you keep in your office \- that's copy 2\. And you backup to encrypted cloud storage \- that's copy 3\. If your office floods, you lose 1 and 2 but still have 3\. If the cloud goes down, you have 1 and 2\. Now here's critical: test your backups. Once a quarter, actually try to restore a file. I've seen organizations lose everything because they thought they had backups, but when they tried to restore, nothing worked. Don't be that organization. And with cloud storage, remember: the company can see your files unless you encrypt them first. For truly sensitive documents, use encryption software before uploading. Finally, we need to talk about AI. ChatGPT, Claude, all these tools are powerful, but never paste sensitive organizational data into them. When you do, that data goes to their servers. It may be used to train their models. It could appear in responses to other users. I've seen this happen. Always remove all identifying information before using AI tools."

Slide 10: Basic Office Security Rules

Headline: Basic Office Security Rules

üìñ Plain English:

Public WiFi \= Internet at cafes, airports, hotels (anyone can spy on it)

Guest Network \= Separate WiFi for visitors (protects your work network)

Network Security \= Protecting your internet connection from unauthorized access

RULE 1: WiFi Security

‚ùå NEVER use public WiFi for:

Accessing email with sensitive information

Banking or financial transactions

Logging into organizational accounts

Accessing cloud storage with beneficiary data

Any work-related activity with sensitive data

‚úÖ If you must use public WiFi:

Use a trusted VPN (we'll cover this later)

Only access non-sensitive public websites

Never log into accounts with confidential information

‚úÖ Secure your office WiFi:

Change default router password (most people never do this\!)

Use WPA3 or WPA2 encryption

Create strong WiFi password (at least 12 characters)

Change WiFi password every 6 months

Create separate guest network for visitors

How to set up guest WiFi:

Log into your router (usually 192.168.1.1)

Look for "Guest Network" setting

Enable it with a different password

This keeps visitors off your work network

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Giving office WiFi password to every visitor

Using default router password ("admin" / "password")

Never changing WiFi password

Not having a guest network

Using public WiFi for sensitive work "just this once"

üí° Real Scenario:

"An organization gave their office WiFi password to a journalist visiting for an interview. That journalist's laptop had malware. The malware spread to their network and accessed shared folders with beneficiary data. This could have been prevented with a guest network."

RULE 2: Physical Device Security

‚úÖ Essential practices:

Lock ALL devices when stepping away (even for 1 minute)

Lock laptops when not in use (Windows \+ L on PC, Command \+ Control \+ Q on Mac)

Close laptop lids (doesn't lock automatically on all devices)

Lock your phone (don't leave it face-up and unlocked on your desk)

Lock your computer shortcut:

Windows: Press Windows key \+ L

Mac: Press Command \+ Control \+ Q

Get in the habit: Every time you stand up, lock it

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

"I'm only gone for a minute"

Leaving laptop open while going to bathroom/lunch

Trusting everyone in the office (insider threats are real)

Not locking phone on desk (someone could install spyware in seconds)

RULE 3: Shared Equipment Security

Printers, Scanners, and Other Shared Devices:

‚úÖ Security checklist for shared printers:

Change default admin password

Update firmware regularly (yes, printers get security updates\!)

Clear print memory regularly

Disable unnecessary features (web printing, cloud printing if not used)

Use secure/PIN printing (print jobs don't print until you enter code at printer)

üìñ Why this matters:

"Network printers store copies of everything they print. If hacked, attackers can access these documents. We've seen cases where old printers sold online still had sensitive documents in their memory."

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Never updating printer firmware

Not clearing print jobs from memory

Leaving sensitive documents sitting in printer tray

Using default printer password

Not knowing your printer is connected to the internet

RULE 4: Personal Devices for Work

If you use personal devices for work:

‚úÖ Minimum requirements:

Full disk encryption enabled

Strong screen lock (6+ digit PIN or passphrase)

Automatic updates ON

Separate work and personal apps when possible

2FA on all work accounts

Password manager installed

‚ö†Ô∏è Risks to discuss with team:

Personal device \= personal risk if compromised

Lost/stolen personal phone \= lost work access

Consider organization-provided devices for high-risk roles

Speaker Notes:

"Think of your digital space like your physical office. You wouldn't leave the front door unlocked overnight. The same rules apply online. Public WiFi is not secure \- it's like having a conversation in a crowded cafe where anyone can listen. If you absolutely must work from a cafe, use a VPN, which we'll cover later. For your office WiFi, please change the default password on your router. Most people never do this. And create a guest network for visitors \- don't give everyone your main office WiFi password. Yes, this includes not giving the office WiFi password to every visitor who asks nicely. Second, lock your devices when you step away. Always. Even if you're just going to the bathroom. Even if you trust everyone in the office. It takes 30 seconds to install spyware on an unlocked phone. Get in the habit: stand up, lock device. Finally, don't forget about your printer. Printers store copies of documents and need security updates too. I know it sounds weird, but we've seen cases where old printers sold online still had sensitive documents in their memory."

Slide 11: The Importance of a Clean Break

Headline: Offboarding \- The Importance of a Clean Break

üìñ Plain English:

Offboarding \= The process of removing someone's access when they leave

Shared Accounts \= Accounts used by multiple people (dangerous\!)

Access Control \= Managing who can access what

Why This Matters:

"When a staff member, volunteer, or intern leaves \- whether on good terms or bad \- you need an immediate offboarding protocol. Every day of delay is a security risk."

üí° Real Scenario:

"An organization had a volunteer leave on bad terms. They forgot to remove her access. Three weeks later, she logged into their Google Drive and deleted critical grant documents out of spite. They had no backup. Don't be that organization."

The Offboarding Checklist:

‚úÖ Do this on the person's last day (or immediately if they leave unexpectedly):

1\. Deactivate Email and App Access

Remove from organizational email system

Deactivate account (don't just remove from groups)

Set up email forwarding if needed (for transition period)

Remove from all cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

Remove from project management tools (Asana, Trello, etc.)

2\. Remove from Communication Platforms

Remove from Signal groups

Remove from WhatsApp groups

Remove from Telegram groups

Remove from Slack/Discord channels

Remove from email distribution lists

3\. Change Shared Account Passwords

Social media accounts

Financial/banking accounts

Any shared logins they had access to

Website admin panels

Donor database

4\. Collect Organizational Property

Laptop/tablet/phone (if org-provided)

Access cards/keys

External hard drives

Any documents or files

5\. Revoke Physical Access

Deactivate office key card/code

Change door codes if they knew them

Update alarm codes

6\. Document Everything

Who left and when

What access they had

What was revoked

Who handled the offboarding

Preventing Problems:

‚úÖ Best practices:

Keep a list of all systems and who has access

No shared passwords \- everyone has their own account

Regular access audits (quarterly: "Who has access to what?")

Use password manager with emergency access feature

Document access permissions

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:

Assuming "they wouldn't do anything bad"

Removing them from some things but forgetting others

Waiting days or weeks to revoke access

Not changing shared passwords

Not having a list of what to deactivate

Template: Offboarding Checklist

PERSON LEAVING: \[Name\]

LAST DAY: \[Date\]

HANDLED BY: \[Your Name\]

‚òê Email deactivated

‚òê Cloud storage access removed

‚òê Chat groups removed

‚òê Social media access changed

‚òê Financial accounts changed

‚òê Project management tools removed

‚òê Website access removed

‚òê Equipment collected

‚òê Physical access revoked

‚òê Documented

Speaker Notes:

"This is a step that many organizations forget, and it's a huge security risk. You must have a checklist to ensure that when someone leaves the team \- whether a staff member, volunteer, or intern \- their digital access is fully and immediately revoked. I've seen too many situations where someone left months ago but still had access to everything. Use this checklist. Do it on their last day. No exceptions. Even if they left on great terms, even if you trust them completely \- people change, circumstances change, and their device might get compromised even if they're not malicious. Also, this is why you should never share passwords. Every person should have their own account for every system. That way, when they leave, you just deactivate their account instead of having to change passwords across 20 different systems."

Slide 12: Choosing the Right Communication Channel

Headline: Choosing the Right Channel

üìñ Plain English:

End-to-end encryption \= Only sender and receiver can read the message

Metadata \= Information about your message (who, when, how long) even if content is encrypted

Secret chats \= A special mode in some apps that adds extra security

Understanding Metadata:

"Even with encryption, some information is still visible:"

WHO you talked to

WHEN you talked

HOW LONG you talked

YOUR LOCATION when you sent the message (sometimes)

Example:

Think of it like a phone bill. The bill doesn't show what you said, but it shows who you called, when, and for how long. That's metadata. Signal minimizes this. WhatsApp collects more of it.

Messaging App Comparison:

üì± SIGNAL \- BEST for sensitive conversations

‚úÖ Pros:

End-to-end encrypted by default

Minimal metadata collection

Open source (security experts can verify it's safe)

Disappearing messages

No connection to Facebook/Meta

Widely trusted by activists and journalists

‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:

Requires phone number (though you can hide it from other users)

Less popular (fewer people use it)

Group chat quality not as good as WhatsApp

When to use: Sensitive discussions about strategy, beneficiaries, finances, or anything that could put people at risk.

üì± WHATSAPP \- OK for general use

‚úÖ Pros:

End-to-end encrypted

Very popular (everyone has it)

Good group chat features

Voice/video calls

‚ö†Ô∏è Cons:

Owned by Meta/Facebook

Collects metadata (who you talk to, when, contact lists)

Data shared with Facebook

Backups not encrypted (if using iCloud/Google Drive backup)

When to use: General team coordination, non-sensitive updates, casual communication.

‚ùå Don't use for: Highly sensitive information about beneficiaries, donors, or strategies that could harm people if exposed.

üì± TELEGRAM \- WARNING: Not secure by default

‚ùå Major Problems:

Messages NOT encrypted by default

Regular chats stored on Telegram servers (unencrypted)

Large groups (100,000+ people) cannot be secured

Company can read your messages unless you use "secret chat"

‚ö†Ô∏è Secret Chats exist but:

Must be manually enabled for each conversation

Only work on one device (not synced)

Most people don't use them

The Reality:

"People think Telegram is secure. It's not. Unless you manually turn on 'secret chats,' your messages aren't encrypted. Telegram can read them, governments can request them. Just use Signal instead."

When to use: Public channels for announcements (that's what it's good for).

‚ùå Don't use for: Any sensitive or confidential communication.

Choosing the Right Tool for Different Scenarios:

ScenarioRecommended ToolWhyDiscussing beneficiary caseSignalEnd-to-end encrypted, minimal metadataPlanning sensitive strategySignalSecure, private, trustedGeneral team coordinationWhatsAppConvenient, encrypted, widely usedPublic announcementsEmail/Social MediaMeant to be publicSharing sensitive documentsEncrypted email or secure file transferNot messaging appsVideo callsSignal or JitsiEnd-to-end encryptedBest Practices for ANY Messaging App:

‚úÖ Do:

Enable disappearing messages for sensitive conversations (Signal, WhatsApp)

Regularly clear chat history

Be careful about who's in group chats (weakest link principle)

Verify important contacts (prevent impersonation)

Turn off message previews on lock screen

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't:

Screenshot sensitive messages (defeats encryption)

Forward sensitive messages to unsecured platforms

Assume group chats are private (someone could be compromised)

Store sensitive information in chat backups

üí° Real Scenario:

"An organization used a Telegram group with 50 people to discuss a sensitive campaign. They thought Telegram was secure. It wasn't using secret chats. When authorities requested data from Telegram, they got full access to all messages, names, and contact information. Several activists were arrested. If they had used Signal, the authorities would have gotten nothing."

Speaker Notes:

"How we talk to each other matters. For sensitive team communications about beneficiaries, donors, or strategy, Signal is the most secure choice. It's end-to-end encrypted, collects minimal data, and is trusted by journalists and activists worldwide. For general chat and coordination, WhatsApp is okay, but be aware of its connection to Meta. They collect data about who you talk to and when, even though they can't read the messages. Now, Telegram \- people think it's secure. It's not. Unless you manually turn on 'secret chats' for each individual conversation, your messages are not encrypted. They're stored on Telegram's servers, and Telegram can read them. Governments can request them. This has happened. Just use Signal for anything sensitive. It's free, it's easy, and it's actually secure."

Part 4: The 'Them' \- Countering External Threats (15 mins)

Slide 13: Dealing with Surveillance and Harassment

Headline: Dealing with Surveillance and Harassment

SECTION 1: Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

üìñ Plain English:

VPN (Virtual Private Network) \= Software that creates a secure, encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic

ISP (Internet Service Provider) \= The company that gives you internet (they can see what websites you visit)

Exit Node \= The VPN server where your traffic exits to the internet

What Does a VPN Actually Do?

WITHOUT VPN:

You ‚Üí ISP (can see everything) ‚Üí Website

‚Üì

Government/hackers can see: feministfund.org, signal.org, your bank

WITH VPN:

You ‚Üí VPN (encrypted tunnel) ‚Üí Website

‚Üì

ISP sees: "Connected to VPN" (nothing else)

What Your ISP/Government Sees:

Without VPN: "She visited feministfund.org, then signal.org, then her bank, then searched for 'women's rights protest'"

With VPN: "She connected to a VPN server. After that, we don't know what she did."

What VPNs CAN Do:

‚úÖ Hide your browsing activity from your ISP and local network

‚úÖ Hide your IP address from websites you visit

‚úÖ Protect you on public WiFi

‚úÖ Access blocked websites

‚úÖ Add a layer of security when using internet in restrictive countries

What VPNs CANNOT Do:

‚ùå Make you completely anonymous (websites still see activity)

‚ùå Protect you if you log into personal accounts (you're still you when logged in)

‚ùå Hide you from the government if they seize VPN servers (if VPN keeps logs)

‚ùå Protect against malware or phishing

Choosing a VPN:

üö® CRITICAL WARNING:

"Free VPNs are worse than no VPN at all. They're making money somehow, and it's by selling your browsing data to advertisers or worse. Pay for a trusted one or don't use one at all."

‚ùå AVOID free VPNs like:

Hola VPN (caught selling user bandwidth)

Any VPN with excessive permissions

VPNs based in countries with poor privacy laws

VPNs that don't have a clear no-logs policy

‚úÖ Recommended VPNs for activists:

Proton VPN (Swiss-based, strong privacy, free tier available but limited)

Mullvad (Swedish, anonymous payment options, no account needed)

IVPN (privacy-focused, independently audited)

RiseupVPN (free for activists, run by activists)

What to look for:

No-logs policy (verified by independent audit)

Based in privacy-respecting country

Open about ownership and funding

Kill switch feature (stops internet if VPN disconnects)

Accepts anonymous payment (if needed)

When to Use a VPN:

‚úÖ Always use VPN for:

Public WiFi (cafes, airports, hotels)

Accessing blocked websites

Researching sensitive topics

When traveling internationally

When your internet provider might be monitoring you

‚ö†Ô∏è VPN limitations to understand:

VPN provider can potentially see your traffic (choose trusted provider)

Logging into personal accounts reveals your identity even with VPN

Governments can sometimes detect VPN use (though not content)

VPNs can slow down internet speed

üí° Real Scenario:

"An activist used a free VPN thinking she was protected. The VPN company was logging all her activity and selling it to data brokers. When authorities requested information, the VPN handed over her complete browsing history. She thought she was invisible. She wasn't."

SECTION 2: Social Media Safety

üìñ Plain English:

Privacy Settings \= Controls for who can see your posts and information

Doxxing \= Publishing someone's private information online (address, phone, family info)

Tagging \= When someone mentions you or identifies you in a post/photo

Lock Down Your Privacy Settings:

‚úÖ Essential settings for ALL platforms:

1\. Profile Visibility

Set profile to private (not public)

Limit who can see your posts (friends only, not public)

Hide friends/followers list

Disable public search (don't appear in search results)

2\. Tagging Controls

Require approval before photos of you are posted

Disable auto-tagging in photos

Review tags before they appear on your profile

3\. Location Services

Disable location on all posts

Remove location metadata from photos before posting

Don't check in to locations

Turn off "places visited" or similar features

4\. Contact Information

Hide phone number

Hide email address

Hide birthday (or make it partially visible)

Don't link other social media accounts

Platform-Specific Critical Settings:

Facebook:

Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Who can see your future posts? ‚Üí Friends (not Public)

Settings ‚Üí Timeline and Tagging ‚Üí Review posts you're tagged in ‚Üí ON

Settings ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Location Services ‚Üí OFF

Instagram:

Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Private Account ‚Üí ON

Settings ‚Üí Tags ‚Üí Hide photos and videos of you ‚Üí ON

Settings ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Add location to posts ‚Üí OFF

Twitter/X:

Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Protect your posts ‚Üí ON

Settings ‚Üí Discoverability ‚Üí Let others find you ‚Üí OFF

Settings ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Tweet location ‚Üí OFF

Preventing Doxxing:

‚ö†Ô∏è Information to NEVER share publicly:

Home address or precise location

Phone number

Names or photos of family members

Your workplace location

Your daily routine or patterns

Travel plans in advance

‚úÖ Good practices:

Use separate personal vs. work social media accounts

Don't post in real-time (post after you've left the location)

Review ALL photos before posting (check background for identifying info)

Don't respond to trolls (engaging makes it worse)

üí° Real Scenario:

"A feminist activist posted a photo from a caf√© with location tagging on. Anti-rights groups used that information to figure out where she lived and worked (by looking at her pattern of check-ins). They published her home address online. She had to move. This could have been prevented by simply turning off location services."

SECTION 3: Physical Device Risks

If Your Device Might Be Confiscated:

‚úÖ Before crossing a border or checkpoint:

Power OFF completely (don't just lock it)

Back up important data beforehand

Remove sensitive apps temporarily

Clear browser history and recent files

Log out of all accounts

Why power OFF?

"Encryption is most powerful when device is powered off. If it's on (even if locked), it's more vulnerable. Powering off gives you maximum protection."

‚úÖ At a checkpoint/during arrest:

Don't unlock if you can safely refuse

Don't provide passwords unless legally required

Remember: anything on the device can be accessed once unlocked

Know your legal rights in your country

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

"Laws vary by country. In some places, you can refuse to unlock. In others, you must comply. Know your rights before you need them. Consult with legal advisors."

Post-Confiscation:

‚úÖ If device is returned:

Assume it's compromised (spyware may be installed)

Don't use it for sensitive work

Factory reset if possible

Change all passwords from a different device

Consider getting a new device for sensitive work

‚úÖ If device is not returned:

Report as stolen (for insurance)

Remotely wipe if possible

Change ALL passwords immediately (from another device)

Warn contacts that your accounts may be compromised

Monitor accounts for unusual activity

How to Remotely Wipe:

iPhone: iCloud.com ‚Üí Find My iPhone ‚Üí Erase iPhone

Android: android.com/find ‚Üí Erase device

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation: Only works if device is connected to internet. Set this up NOW, before you need it.

Speaker Notes:

"With our internal security stronger, we can face the outside world. Let's talk about VPNs first. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic. Without a VPN, your internet provider can see every website you visit. With a VPN, they just see that you're connected to a VPN server \- they can't see what you do after that. But here's critical: free VPNs are worse than no VPN. They're making money somehow, and it's usually by selling your browsing data. Pay for a trusted VPN like Proton, Mullvad, or use RiseupVPN which is free for activists. Use a VPN when you're on public WiFi, when accessing blocked sites, or when you need to hide your browsing from your ISP. Now, social media. Lock down your privacy settings. Don't post with location tags. Don't share information that reveals where you live or your daily patterns. I've seen activists doxxed because they posted photos from the same caf√© every morning \- people figured out where they worked and lived. Finally, if you're at risk of device confiscation \- at a border, checkpoint, or protest \- power off your device completely. Encryption works best when the device is off. If it's on but locked, it's more vulnerable. And if you can, back up and remove sensitive data before high-risk situations."

Part 5: The 'Now What?' \- From Plan to Practice (10 mins)

Slide 14: Do These 3 Things Before You Leave Today

Headline: Do These 3 Things Before You Leave Today

No excuses. No 'I'll do it later.' Do these NOW.

‚úÖ ACTION 1: Install a Password Manager

Why: You can't remember strong, unique passwords for dozens of accounts. A password manager does it for you.

Step-by-step (5 minutes):

Download Bitwarden (FREE) or 1Password from official app store

Create account with a VERY strong master passphraseExample: "I-Love-Lebanese-Food-On-Friday-Nights-77"

Install browser extension

Add your first 5 most important passwords:Email

Banking

Social media

Cloud storage

Any work accounts

Let password manager generate new strong passwords when you create accounts

How to access: You type your master passphrase once, then password manager auto-fills passwords for you.

‚ö†Ô∏è Common mistake: Using a weak master password. This is the ONE password you must make incredibly strong because it protects everything.

‚úÖ ACTION 2: Enable 2FA on Your Email

Why: Your email is the key to everything. If someone gets into your email, they can reset passwords for all your other accounts. Protect it.

Step-by-step (3 minutes):

For Gmail:

Go to myaccount.google.com

Click "Security" in left menu

Scroll to "2-Step Verification"

Click "Get Started"

Follow prompts (choose "Authenticator app" NOT "Text message")

Save backup codes somewhere safe (write on paper, store securely)

For Outlook/Microsoft:

Go to account.microsoft.com/security

Click "Advanced security options"

Click "Turn on" two-step verification

Choose "App" method

Follow prompts and save backup codes

For Other Email Providers:

Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Two-factor authentication

Choose authenticator app method

Save backup codes

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Save those backup codes\! If you lose your phone, this is how you get back into your account.

‚úÖ ACTION 3: Review Your Main Social Media Privacy Settings

Why: Most people's social media is wide open. This takes 3 minutes and dramatically reduces your risk.

Quick checklist (3 minutes):

Facebook:

Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí "Who can see your future posts?" ‚Üí Change to Friends

Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí "Who can see your friends list?" ‚Üí Change to Only Me

Settings ‚Üí Timeline and Tagging ‚Üí "Review tags people add" ‚Üí Turn ON

Settings ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Turn OFF

Instagram:

Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Private Account ‚Üí Turn ON

Settings ‚Üí Tags ‚Üí "Manually approve tags" ‚Üí Turn ON

Remove location from old posts if possible

Twitter/X:

Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Protect your posts ‚Üí Turn ON (makes account private)

Settings ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Tweet location ‚Üí Turn OFF

‚ö†Ô∏è What this does:

Limits who can see your posts (not the whole world)

Prevents people from tagging you without permission

Stops location tracking

Makes it harder to build a profile of your movements and connections

Track Your Progress:

MY DIGITAL SECURITY CHECKLIST

TODAY (before leaving):

‚òê Password manager installed and set up

‚òê 2FA enabled on email (backup codes saved)

‚òê Social media privacy settings reviewed and locked down

THIS WEEK:

‚òê Enable 2FA on banking apps

‚òê Enable 2FA on cloud storage

‚òê Review what data I'm storing (do I need all of it?)

‚òê Set up automatic backups

THIS MONTH:

‚òê Enable 2FA on all important accounts

‚òê Test my backups (try restoring a file)

‚òê Install Signal and migrate sensitive conversations

‚òê Review who has access to what in my organization

Speaker Notes:

"Knowledge is good, but action is better. I want everyone to leave here with three concrete things done today. Not 'I'll do it later' \- we're doing it now. First, install a password manager. It takes 5 minutes. Second, enable 2FA on your email. This is the single most important thing you can do. Third, lock down your social media privacy settings. These three actions alone will dramatically improve your security. I'm serious. Don't leave this room without at least starting on one of these. Pull out your phones right now. Let's do this together. I'll walk around and help anyone who needs it."

Slide 15: Your Incident Response Plan

Headline: When (Not If) Something Goes Wrong

üìñ Plain English:

Incident \= A security problem (hacked account, stolen device, suspicious activity)

Compromised \= Hacked or accessed by unauthorized person

Remotely wipe \= Delete all data on device from another device

The Reality:

"When (not if) something goes wrong, don't panic. Having a plan is what separates a minor incident from a disaster."

SCENARIO 1: Device is Stolen or Lost

‚úÖ Immediate actions (within 1 hour):

Try to locate it:

iPhone: iCloud.com ‚Üí Find My iPhone

Android: android.com/find

Can you see its location? Is it moving?

Decide: Wipe or Track?

If device has sensitive data ‚Üí Wipe immediately

If you think you can recover it ‚Üí Track for 24 hours, then wipe

Important: Once wiped, you can't track it anymore

Change critical passwords (from another device):

Email

Banking/financial

Cloud storage

Any work accounts that were logged in

Contact your organization:

Report to IT officer (that's me\!)

Document what data was on the device

Assess what might be compromised

Report to authorities (if needed):

Police report (for insurance)

Document when and where it was stolen

‚ö†Ô∏è Common mistakes:

Waiting too long to wipe device

Not changing passwords immediately

Assuming thief just wants the hardware (they want your data)

üí° Prevention:

Set up Find My Device NOW (before it's stolen)

Enable remote wipe NOW

Regular backups so wiping doesn't mean losing everything

SCENARIO 2: Account is Hacked

‚úÖ Immediate actions:

Try to recover the account:

Use "Forgot password" or account recovery options

If you have 2FA enabled, hacker can't change password without your phone

Check recovery email and phone number (hacker may have changed them)

Change password immediately (if you regain access):

Use password manager to create strong new password

Enable 2FA if you hadn't already

Check account activity:

Review login locations and devices

Check what the hacker did (emails sent, files accessed, contacts messaged)

Look for unfamiliar connected apps or devices

Warn your contacts:

Post/message: "My account was compromised. If you received weird messages from me, ignore them."

Warn about potential phishing attempts using your account

Check related accounts:

Did hacker access other accounts through this one?

Change passwords on accounts that used same password

Review recent account activity on other platforms

Report to platform:

Most platforms have "My account was hacked" reporting

They can help secure the account

‚ö†Ô∏è Common mistakes:

Not warning contacts (they might get phished)

Only changing hacked account password (if you reused password, all accounts with that password are vulnerable)

Not checking what hacker accessed

SCENARIO 3: Suspicious Activity

Warning signs that something might be wrong:

Emails sent from your account you didn't send

Files in your cloud storage you didn't upload

Login alerts from locations you've never been

Contacts receiving weird messages from you

Computer running slower than usual

Pop-ups or unfamiliar programs

Redirected search results

Bank transactions you didn't make

‚úÖ What to do:

Don't panic, but act quickly:

Document what you've noticed (screenshot if possible)

Don't click any suspicious links or pop-ups

Change passwords immediately:

Start with email and most critical accounts

Use different device if you suspect current device is compromised

Run security scan:

Update antivirus and run full scan

Use Malwarebytes (free) for additional scan

Contact IT officer:

That's me\! \[Your contact info\]

Better to report something that turns out to be nothing than ignore something serious

Review account security:

Check connected devices and apps

Revoke access to anything suspicious

Enable 2FA if not already on

SCENARIO 4: Phishing Email / Clicked Suspicious Link

If you clicked a suspicious link or downloaded attachment:

‚úÖ Immediate actions:

Don't enter any information:

If you opened a fake login page, don't type anything

Close the browser immediately

Disconnect from internet:

Turn off WiFi or unplug ethernet

Prevents malware from spreading or sending data

Change passwords (from different device):

If you entered any credentials, change those passwords immediately

Use a different device to do this

Run security scans:

Update antivirus

Run full system scan

Use Malwarebytes for additional scan

Monitor accounts:

Watch for suspicious activity for next few weeks

Check bank accounts and credit cards

Report the phishing attempt:

Forward to your email provider's phishing report address

Gmail: reportphishing@google.com

Outlook: phish@office365.microsoft.com

‚ö†Ô∏è If you ENTERED information:

Change those passwords immediately (from different device)

Enable 2FA on those accounts

Contact banks if you entered financial information

Monitor accounts closely

Building a Security Culture:

üí° Remember:

Security is not a one-time thing \- it's a practice

Start small, build habits, be consistent

You don't need to be perfect, just better than you were yesterday

Help each other \- share knowledge with your team

When in doubt, ask for help

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

Doing everything at once and getting overwhelmed

Implementing security measures so strict nobody follows them

Blaming people when mistakes happen (creates fear, not security)

Thinking "we're too small to be targeted"

Waiting for the "perfect" security setup before starting

‚úÖ What Works:

Small, consistent improvements over time

Making security practices simple and sustainable

Creating a no-blame culture where people feel safe reporting issues

Regular reminders and refreshers (quarterly security check-ins)

Celebrating security wins (team enabled 2FA\! Let's celebrate\!)

You need help setting up any security tools

You have questions about what tool to use

You want a security review for your organization

You're planning something high-risk and need advice

Anything security-related \- no question is too small\!

Response times:

Emergencies: Within 1-2 hours

Urgent questions: Same day

General questions: Within 24 hours

Final Words:

"Thank you all for being here today. I know this is a lot of information. You might feel overwhelmed \- that's normal. Security isn't something you 'do' once and you're done. It's ongoing. Start small, build habits, and reach out when you need help.

Remember three things:

You are a target because your work matters. Taking security seriously isn't paranoia \- it's professional responsibility.

Perfect security doesn't exist. Don't let the pursuit of perfection stop you from taking practical steps today. Better security tomorrow than perfect security never.

You are not alone. We're building this together. Share knowledge, support each other, and reach out when you need help.

The work you do \- advocating for women's rights, supporting survivors, challenging injustice \- is vital. Digital security is what allows you to keep doing that work safely. You deserve protection. Your beneficiaries deserve protection. And now you have the tools to make that happen.

Thank you for your time, your attention, and your commitment to this work. Now, let's open the floor for questions."

OPEN FLOOR FOR QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

Facilitation Tips:

‚úÖ Creating safe space for questions:

"There are no stupid questions. If you're confused, someone else probably is too."

"You can ask anonymously \- write questions on paper and pass them forward."

"Questions about your specific situation? We can talk privately after."

‚úÖ Common questions to prepare for:

"Isn't this all too complicated for small organizations?"

"We can't afford paid tools \- what are the alternatives?"

"What if my team resists these changes?"

"How do we balance security with getting work done quickly?"

"What's the one most important thing if we can only do one thing?"

‚úÖ If you don't know the answer:

"That's a great question. I don't know the answer off the top of my head, but I'll find out and get back to you."

Better to admit you don't know than to give wrong information

APPENDIX: Using Good Tools the Right Way

(Hand out this section as a reference document)

1\. Encrypted Messaging Apps (Signal, WhatsApp)

What Not to Do:

Believing a chat is 100% private just because the app is encrypted

Taking screenshots of sensitive information and storing them in an insecure photo gallery

Adding people to sensitive group chats without verifying their identity

Using disappearing messages but then taking photos of the screen

Backing up chats to unencrypted cloud storage

What to Do Instead:

Use disappearing messages for sensitive topics (Signal: tap contact ‚Üí Disappearing messages ‚Üí choose timeframe)

Regularly clear your chat history for sensitive conversations

Be mindful of who is in a group and what you share

Avoid screenshots; if you must take one, store it in encrypted storage and delete ASAP

Verify contacts before adding to sensitive groups (Signal: tap contact ‚Üí View safety number)

Disable cloud backups for sensitive accounts or use encrypted backups only

Why It Matters:

The app is secure. You might not be. That's the weak link. A compromised device, or a screenshot shared with the wrong person, bypasses all encryption. In our context, a single screenshot can be used as "evidence" in legal cases or for public shaming campaigns. And if you're in a group chat with 50 people, it's only as secure as the least careful person in that group.

Additional Best Practices:

Enable screen security (prevents screenshots): Signal ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Screen security

Set registration lock (prevents SIM swap attacks): Signal ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Registration lock

Use Signal PINs to protect your account

Turn off message previews on lock screen

Don't forward sensitive messages to other platforms

2\. "Private" or "Incognito" Browsing

What Not to Do:

Thinking it makes you anonymous online

Believing it hides your activity from your internet service provider (ISP), employer, or government

Using it to access sensitive work accounts thinking it's more secure

Assuming websites can't track you

What to Do Instead:

Understand its only real purpose: it stops your browser from saving your history and cookies on that specific device

For real privacy from outside observers, use a trusted VPN

For anonymity, use Tor Browser (though understand its limitations)

Incognito mode is useful for: logging into multiple accounts, testing how website looks to logged-out users, avoiding cookies

Why It Matters:

Assuming incognito mode provides anonymity creates a false sense of security, which is dangerous when researching sensitive topics. State actors and ISPs can still see your internet activity. Incognito mode is for hiding your browsing history from your roommate, not from the government.

What Incognito Mode Does:

‚úì Prevents browser from saving history on your device

‚úì Prevents cookies from being saved after you close the window

‚úì Prevents autofill suggestions based on this session

What Incognito Mode Does NOT Do:

‚úó Hide your activity from ISP or network administrator

‚úó Hide your IP address from websites

‚úó Prevent tracking by websites

‚úó Make you anonymous

‚úó Prevent employers/schools from seeing your activity on their network

3\. Cloud Backups (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox)

What Not to Do:

Automatically syncing everything from your devices without reviewing what is being uploaded

Assuming the cloud provider cannot access or be forced to hand over your data

Storing unencrypted sensitive documents (beneficiary data, internal strategies)

Using weak passwords or no 2FA on cloud accounts

Sharing links set to "anyone with link can view"

What to Do Instead:

Be selective about what you sync \- don't automatically backup everything

Don't back up highly sensitive photos or documents unless they are encrypted before upload

Always use a strong, unique passphrase and 2FA on your cloud account

Use Cryptomator or similar to encrypt sensitive folders before uploading

Review sharing permissions regularly (who has access to what?)

Set expiration dates on shared links

Use "specific people" sharing rather than "anyone with link"

Why It Matters:

Cloud accounts are a primary target for hackers. If they gain access, they have a copy of your life's data. Governments can and do request data from Google, Apple, Dropbox, etc. And these companies usually comply. In many cases, companies are legally required to hand over data when authorities request it.

How to Encrypt Before Uploading:

Download Cryptomator (free and open source)

Create a "vault" (encrypted folder) on your computer

Put sensitive files in this vault

Vault is automatically encrypted

Upload the encrypted vault folder to Google Drive/Dropbox

Cloud provider only sees encrypted gibberish

Cloud Provider Comparison:

Google Drive: Scans content, integrates with Google services, subject to US law

Dropbox: Good sync, less scanning, subject to US law

iCloud: Apple's ecosystem, some encryption, subject to US law

Proton Drive: End-to-end encrypted, Swiss privacy laws, limited storage

Tresorit: Zero-knowledge encryption, Swiss/EU privacy laws, paid only

4\. Device Encryption

What Not to Do:

Believing it protects your device while it is turned on and unlocked

Using a simple, easy-to-guess PIN like 1234 or a basic swipe pattern

Thinking encryption makes you invincible

Forgetting to encrypt external drives and USB sticks

Using fingerprint/face unlock in high-risk situations

What to Do Instead:

Understand that encryption is most powerful when your device is turned OFF

Use a long, alphanumeric passphrase, not a simple PIN (at least 8 characters)

If you fear device confiscation at a checkpoint or during an arrest, power it down completely

Encrypt all external drives that contain sensitive data

Disable biometric unlock (fingerprint/face) for high-risk situations

On iPhone: Settings ‚Üí Face ID & Passcode ‚Üí Turn off for specific functions

On Android: Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Face/fingerprint unlock ‚Üí disable

Use "lockdown mode" on modern phones (disables biometrics temporarily)

Why It Matters:

If someone has physical access to your phone and can force you to unlock it, encryption can't help you. That's why you power it off. A powered-off encrypted device is significantly harder to break into. A simple PIN can be guessed by observing you ("shoulder surfing") or from fingerprint smudges on the screen.

Understanding Encryption States:

Device OFF: Maximum protection, requires password to decrypt

Device ON but locked: Some protection, but more vulnerable

Device ON and unlocked: Encryption provides minimal protection

Emergency Features:

iPhone: Press power button 5 times quickly \= disables Face ID/Touch ID

Android: Hold power button ‚Üí Lockdown mode (on newer phones)

Both: Power OFF completely for maximum protection

5\. Secure File Deletion

What Not to Do:

Thinking that dragging a file to the Trash/Recycle Bin and emptying it permanently erases the file

Assuming deleted files are gone forever

Deleting sensitive files normally before selling/donating device

Using "secure delete" on SSDs the same way as HDDs (different technology)

What to Do Instead:

For highly sensitive files, use a dedicated "file shredder" application to securely overwrite the file's data

When getting rid of a computer, use the built-in "Secure Erase" or factory reset functions

Understand the difference between HDDs and SSDs (solid state drives need different approach)

For maximum security on old devices: physical destruction of drive

Encrypt your device from day one \- then even "normal" deletion is more secure

Why It Matters:

Files "deleted" normally can often be recovered with simple software. If a device is stolen, confiscated, or sold, that sensitive data could be retrieved. Journalists, activists, and researchers have had their "deleted" files recovered and used against them.

How to Securely Delete:

On Windows:

Use Eraser (free): eraser.heidi.ie

Right-click file ‚Üí Eraser ‚Üí Erase

For entire drive before disposal: Settings ‚Üí Recovery ‚Üí Reset this PC ‚Üí Remove everything

On Mac:

For SSDs (most modern Macs): secure delete is automatic with FileVault encryption enabled

Use Permanent Eraser (free) for extra security

Before selling: System Preferences ‚Üí Erase all content and settings

On Linux:

Use shred command: shred \-vfz \-n 10 filename

Use BleachBit (free): bleachbit.org

Before Selling/Donating Device:

Backup everything you need

Factory reset / secure erase

Reinstall operating system

For high-sensitivity situations: physically destroy the hard drive

Note on SSDs:

Traditional "shredding" doesn't work the same on SSDs due to how they store data. The most secure approach: full disk encryption from day one \+ factory reset when disposing.

6\. VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)

What Not to Do:

Using the first "free" VPN you find in the app store

Trusting a VPN that has a history of logging user data

Thinking VPN makes you completely anonymous

Logging into personal accounts while on VPN and thinking you're anonymous

Using VPN from company based in privacy-hostile country

What to Do Instead:

Use a reputable, paid VPN service that has a strict, independently audited "no-logs" policy

Choose a provider based outside of surveillance-heavy jurisdictions (avoid US, UK, Australia, China)

Read privacy policy carefully \- what data do they collect?

Look for independent audits of their "no-logs" claims

Check for kill switch feature (stops internet if VPN disconnects)

Use VPN for its actual purposes: hiding activity from ISP, accessing blocked sites, security on public WiFi

Why It Matters:

A bad VPN is worse than no VPN at all. It gives you a dangerous false sense of security while actively collecting all of your internet traffic, which can then be sold to advertisers, data brokers, or handed over to authorities. Free VPNs make money by selling your data \- that's their business model.

Recommended VPN Features:

‚úì Independently audited no-logs policy

‚úì Based in privacy-respecting jurisdiction (Switzerland, Iceland, Sweden)

‚úì Kill switch (stops traffic if VPN disconnects)

‚úì OpenVPN or WireGuard protocol support

‚úì No DNS leaks

‚úì Accept anonymous payment (Bitcoin, cash) if you need anonymity

‚úì Multiple server locations

‚úì No logging of IP addresses, browsing activity, or connection timestamps

Red Flags:

‚úó Free with no clear business model

‚úó Based in US, UK, China, Russia

‚úó Promises of "total anonymity"

‚úó No information about company ownership

‚úó Asks for excessive permissions

‚úó Has been caught logging despite claims

VPN Limitations to Understand:

VPN provider can see your traffic (choose trustworthy provider)

Logging into Facebook while on VPN \= Facebook knows it's you

Some governments can detect VPN use (though not content)

VPN can slow down internet speed

Not a substitute for other security measures

7\. Antivirus Software

What Not to Do:

Installing it once and then forgetting about it

Ignoring notifications to update the software

Letting subscription lapse and thinking old version still protects you

Thinking antivirus is a substitute for safe browsing habits

Installing multiple antivirus programs (they conflict)

What to Do Instead:

Enable automatic updates for both the software itself and its virus definitions

Run scans regularly (at least weekly)

Remember that it's a safety net, not a replacement for cautious behavior

Don't open suspicious email attachments even with antivirus installed

Keep your operating system updated (OS updates fix security holes)

Use built-in protection on modern systems (often sufficient)

Why It Matters:

Antivirus software is in a constant race against new viruses and malware. If it isn't constantly updated, it cannot protect you from the latest threats, giving you a false sense of safety. An out-of-date antivirus is almost useless.

Honest Reality:

Windows 10/11: Built-in Windows Defender is actually pretty good. You probably don't need third-party antivirus if you're careful.

Mac: Built-in protection is decent. Don't click sketchy links and you'll be fine.

Linux: Generally safer, but not immune. Be cautious with software sources.

When You DO Need Extra Protection:

Downloading files frequently from internet

Opening documents from unknown sources

Shared computers (multiple users)

High-risk targets (activists, journalists)

Recommended Free Options:

Windows Defender (built-in on Windows)

Malwarebytes (free version for scanning)

ClamAV (open source, works on all platforms)

What Antivirus Cannot Stop:

Phishing attacks (tricking you into giving credentials)

Social engineering

Zero-day exploits (brand new attacks)

You willingly installing malicious software

Targeted attacks by skilled hackers

Best Protection:

Safe browsing habits \> Antivirus software. Think before you click.

8\. QR Codes & URL Shorteners

What Not to Do:

Using random online QR generators for sensitive links (they see and may store your data)

Scanning QR codes in public without checking where they lead

Using free URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl) for confidential information

Clicking shortened links without previewing the destination

Creating custom short URLs that reveal sensitive information

Posting QR codes without physical security measures

What to Do Instead:

Use offline QR generators or trusted privacy-respecting ones (DuckDuckGo) for sensitive content

Always preview where a QR code leads before visiting the site

For sensitive links, use full URLs shared through secure channels (Signal)

Check QR codes regularly for tampering (especially at public events)

If you must use URL shorteners, self-host (YOURLS) or use your own domain

Preview shortened links before clicking: use CheckShortURL.com or GetLinkInfo.com

Why It Matters:

QR codes can be swapped with malicious ones (especially at protests or public events). URL shorteners track everyone who clicks and can be hijacked. Both expose your data to third parties who may share it with governments or bad actors. For activism work, this is a real risk.

QR Code Risks:

Data exposure: Online generator sees the URL/text you encode

Malicious injection: Sketchy generators can modify your URL to include tracking or redirect to malicious sites

Physical substitution: Attacker prints fake QR sticker over your real one (common at protests, donation campaigns)

Cannot read with eyes: You don't know where it goes until you scan it

URL Shortener Risks:

Tracking: Shortener sees who clicked, when, location, device type

Link hijacking: If your account is hacked, attacker can change where link goes

Dependency: Service shuts down \= all your links break

Government blocking: Some countries block entire shortener domains

Trust issues: Can't see destination before clicking

Safe QR Code Practices:

‚úì Use offline QR generator (apps that don't send data to servers)

‚úì Print the full URL below the QR code (so people know where it goes)

‚úì Use tamper-evident materials for physical QR codes

‚úì Check QR codes regularly at events (make sure they haven't been replaced)

‚úì Never encode passwords or sensitive credentials in QR codes

Safe URL Shortening:

‚úì Don't shorten sensitive links \- use full URLs

‚úì If you must: self-host with YOURLS on your own domain

‚úì Enable 2FA on shortener account (prevent hijacking)

‚úì Monitor links regularly (check they still go where intended)

‚úì Set expiration dates when possible

When Scanning QR Codes:

‚úì Use apps that preview URL before opening

‚úì Be suspicious of QR stickers covering other QRs

‚úì Never scan random QRs without context

‚úì Check URL looks legitimate before visiting

When Clicking Short Links:

‚úì Use link preview services first

‚úì Hover over link (desktop) to see URL preview

‚úì Be suspicious in unexpected emails/messages

‚úì When in doubt, ask sender for full URL
